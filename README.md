# Getting Started with React + Vite

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# React Project
This is a React project that implements a variety of interactive UI components, including accordions, feature flags, file/folder views, search autocomplete, and infinite scrolling.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Bhavukkanvaria/react-project`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ReactJS-Projects`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

Tip: Right now HMR is disabled but you can change this in vite.config file in the server object.
